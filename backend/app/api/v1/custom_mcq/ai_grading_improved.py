Candidate's Answer: {answer}

Maximum Marks: {max_marks}
{rubric_context}{answer_key_context}
Grading Style: {style_instructions.get(grading_style, style_instructions["balanced"])}

Please evaluate the answer based on these criteria (weight each equally):
1. **Accuracy and Correctness** (20%): Is the information factually correct? Are there any errors?
2. **Completeness** (20%): Does the answer address all parts of the question? Are key points covered?
3. **Clarity and Coherence** (20%): Is the answer well-structured and easy to understand?
4. **Depth of Understanding** (20%): Does the answer demonstrate deep understanding or just surface knowledge?
5. **Relevance** (20%): Is the answer directly relevant to the question? Is there irrelevant content?

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format (use JSON mode):
{{
    "score": <number between 0 and {max_marks}, can be decimal>,
    "criteria_scores": {{
        "accuracy": <0-1 score>,
        "completeness": <0-1 score>,
        "clarity": <0-1 score>,
        "depth": <0-1 score>,
        "relevance": <0-1 score>
    }},
    "feedback": "<constructive, specific feedback for the candidate - 2-3 sentences>",
    "reasoning": "<brief explanation of why this score was awarded - 1-2 sentences>",
    "strengths": ["<key strength 1>", "<key strength 2>"],
    "improvements": ["<area for improvement 1>", "<area for improvement 2>"],
    "confidence": <0-1, how confident you are in this evaluation>
}}

Guidelines:
- Score should reflect the overall quality relative to maximum marks
- Be specific in feedback - mention what was good and what could be improved
- Confidence should be lower if the answer is ambiguous or partially correct
- If answer is completely wrong or irrelevant, score should be near 0
- If answer is excellent and comprehensive, score should be near maximum

# Comparison: Current vs Improved
"""
CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ Works well for basic grading
✅ Cost-effective
✅ Provides feedback
⚠️ Limited detail in evaluation
⚠️ No rubric support
⚠️ No confidence scores
⚠️ No criteria breakdown

IMPROVED VERSION:
✅ JSON mode for reliability
✅ Detailed criteria breakdown
✅ Rubric and answer key support
✅ Confidence scores
✅ Strengths/improvements list
✅ Customizable grading styles
✅ More detailed feedback
⚠️ Slightly more expensive (more tokens)
⚠️ Requires OpenAI API with JSON mode support
