"""
AI Feedback Service for Code Submissions
Provides automated feedback on code quality, efficiency, and correctness.

IMPORTANT: This is a LeetCode-style online judge where users ONLY write the function body.
The platform automatically injects the main() method and handles all I/O.
This service is LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC - it works with any language Judge0 supports.

Evaluation Rules:
1. Completely ignore the user's main() method
2. Do NOT penalize missing input handling, missing output, empty main(), or lack of printing
3. The user is NEVER expected to handle input/output themselves
4. Evaluate ONLY the function implementation written by the user
5. Score based on: correctness, time complexity, space complexity, edge-case handling, code clarity
6. A missing or empty main() must NOT reduce the score
7. If the function logic is correct, score should reflect that regardless of main()

Do NOT give any points (not even 35) for starter code submissions. Starter code is just a template and does not solve the problem.

**IMPORTANT:** Since {total_passed}/{total_tests} test cases passed, this indicates the user wrote actual implementation code. Evaluate based on test results, code structure, and implementation quality.

This platform supports ANY programming language that Judge0 supports.

CRITICAL EVALUATION RULES:
1. Users ONLY write the function implementation - they do NOT handle input/output
2. The platform automatically wraps the user's function with I/O handling
3. COMPLETELY IGNORE any main() method, input reading, output printing code
4. Do NOT penalize for missing I/O handling - users are NOT supposed to write it
5. Evaluate ONLY the function/algorithm implementation
6. If the function logic is correct and all tests pass, the score should be 100/100
7. Empty or missing main() must NOT reduce the score
8. Be LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC - the same rules apply regardless of programming language
9. ANALYZE THE ACTUAL CODE to determine time and space complexity - do not guess, analyze the loops, data structures, and algorithm logic{sql_note}{starter_code_check}

**Question:** {question_title}

**Description:** {question_description[:500]}...

**Language:** {language}

**User's Code (function implementation only - ignore any I/O code):**
```
{source_code}
```

**Test Results:** {test_summary}{failed_details}

**Test Case Breakdown:**
- Public test cases: {public_passed}/{public_total} passed
- Hidden test cases: {hidden_passed}/{hidden_total} passed
- Total: {total_passed}/{total_tests} passed

IMPORTANT: Analyze the actual code structure to determine time and space complexity:
- Count loops and their nesting levels
- Identify the actual iteration bounds (e.g., if loop goes up to √n, it's O(√n), not O(n))
- Check what data structures are created
- Analyze the algorithm logic carefully
- For prime checking: if loop iterates up to √n (e.g., i * i <= n), complexity is O(√n), not O(n)

Evaluate ONLY the function implementation and provide comprehensive, detailed feedback in this JSON format:

SCORING GUIDELINES (PRIORITIZE TEST CASES PASSED):
- **PRIMARY FACTOR: Test cases passed** - This is the most important indicator of correctness
- **If ALL tests pass (100%): overall_score = 100 (perfect solution)** - Must score 100 if all tests pass
- **If 80-99% tests pass: overall_score = 85-99 (excellent, minor issues)** - Base score should be close to pass rate
- **If 60-79% tests pass: overall_score = 70-84 (good, needs some fixes)** - Base score should reflect pass rate
- **If 40-59% tests pass: overall_score = 55-69 (fair, significant issues)** - Base score should reflect pass rate
- **If <40% tests pass: overall_score = 35-54 (poor, major revision needed)** - Base score should reflect pass rate
- **If user submitted only starter code (no implementation AND 0 tests passed): overall_score = 0 (MANDATORY - do not give any points)**

Within each range, adjust based on:
- **Code structure and implementation quality** (clarity, organization, maintainability): ±5 points
- **Algorithm efficiency** (optimal time/space complexity): ±5 points
- **Edge case handling** (based on test results): ±5 points

**CRITICAL:** If test cases passed, the user wrote actual code. Evaluate based on:
1. Test cases passed (primary factor)
2. Code structure and implementation quality
3. Algorithm efficiency
4. Edge case handling
